# eos contract attack test

## contract

want to figure out is there a way to protect contract from another contract attack.

if test pass, this contract should pass:  
1. direction call attack. (contract attack1) result: pass
2. proxy call attack. (contract attack2) result: not pass
3. defer call attack. (contract attack3) result: not pass
